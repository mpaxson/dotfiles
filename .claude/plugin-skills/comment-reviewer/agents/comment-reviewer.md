# Comment Reviewer

Load the `comment-reviewer:comment-reviewer` skill first — it holds the review method and the
precedence order. This file covers only the mechanics of a run.

## Pipeline

Everything below runs through three scripts, invoked with Bash (there is no Python import path
inside an installed plugin). Set this once:

```bash
SCRIPTS="${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/comment-reviewer/scripts"
```

1. Resolve repository state in one call:

   ```bash
   python3 "$SCRIPTS/gitpaths.py" .
   ```

   It prints JSON with `receipt_root`, `head_commit`, `head_tree`, `trunk`, `base`,
   `in_progress`, and `touched`. `base` is already `merge-base <trunk> HEAD` — **never** use the
   branch's own upstream. After `git push -u origin feat`, `@{u}` is `origin/feat`, the diff
   against it is empty, and the sweep would silently examine nothing while still satisfying the
   gate.
2. If `gitpaths.py` exits non-zero (it cannot resolve a trunk ref), stop: write **no receipt**
   and return `base_unresolved` so the caller can supply an explicit base ref.
3. If `in_progress` is non-null — a rebase, merge, cherry-pick, revert, or bisect **in
   progress** — stop and write no receipt. Committing during any of these corrupts the
   operation.
4. Extract comments from the `touched` files and judge each span against the skill's precedence
   order. Spans arriving with a non-null `skip` are never edited.

   ```bash
   printf '%s\n' "${TOUCHED[@]}" | python3 "$SCRIPTS/extract_comments.py"
   ```
5. Apply edits per file in **descending `start_line` order** — deletions and multi-line
   condensing invalidate every later line number in that file, so editing bottom-up is what
   keeps the remaining line numbers valid.
6. Skip any file with pre-existing staged or unstaged modifications; report it as `dirty`. The
   sweep never mixes its edits with work already in progress.
7. Re-run the repo's build, lint, or test command if one is obvious. On failure, revert the
   sweep and report rather than committing broken code.
8. Commit with an **explicit file list**:

   ```bash
   git commit -m "comments: <n> rewritten across <m> files" -- <edited paths>
   ```

   Never `git commit -a`, never `-A`, never a bare `git commit` — a bare commit would ship
   whatever was already staged under a `comments:` message instead of only the paths this sweep
   edited.

   One subject line only: **no body, no watermark, no `Co-Authored-By` trailer.** This plugin
   ships publicly and is not installed by every user who carries that trailer convention in
   their own CLAUDE.md — the rule has to live here, not be inherited.
9. If the commit fails, or HEAD did not move while edits were pending (a reformatting or
   rejecting pre-commit hook, for instance), **abort and write no receipt** — otherwise the
   receipt certifies an unfixed tree and the PR ships without the rewrites.
10. Write the receipt against the resulting HEAD tree, passing the report on stdin:

    ```bash
    printf '%s' "$REPORT_JSON" | python3 "$SCRIPTS/receipt.py" write --base-ref "$TRUNK"
    ```

    where `$TRUNK` is the `trunk` value from step 1 (or the explicit base ref the caller
    supplied) and `$REPORT_JSON` is `{"fixed": {"A": n, "B": n, "C": n}, "skipped": [...],
    "reported": [...]}`. Add `--partial` when a cap below was hit.
11. Return per-class fixed counts plus every report-only finding as `{file, line, class,
    reason}` so the caller can echo it and retry `pr create`.

## Caps

At most **60 files** and **150 edits** per run. On overflow: stop editing, write the receipt
with `--partial`, and list the unprocessed files in the report so a repeat dispatch resumes
rather than re-hitting the same wall. Never silently truncate — a partial sweep that looks
complete is worse than an explicit one.

## No-edit runs

A sweep that finds nothing still writes a receipt, against the current HEAD tree, with zero
counts. There is nothing to commit.
